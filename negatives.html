        <p class="lead"> Social media has changed how we go about our day-to-day lives, and many find it a necessity in today's society. However, recent evidence suggests it may create more harm than good. The question then doesn't become whether social media has value. The question becomes: is it worth it given the problems it causes?</p>

        <h2>The Mental Health Crisis Among Youth</h2>
        <p>
          A connection between social media and the declining mental health of young people has become clear
          over the last few years. For example, teenagers who regularly engage with social media platforms
          face three times the risk of depression or anxiety diagnoses compared to teenagers who don't (NYC
          Department of Health). This is even more true among young people already struggling with their
          mental health. A University of Texas Southwestern study examining 489 patients across twelve Texas
          medical centers found that 40% of youth being treated for depression and suicidal thoughts had what
          they termed "problematic social media use," which basically just means they were really distressed
          when they couldn't access platforms, just like any other form of addiction (UT Southwestern Medical
          Center).
        </p>

        <p>
          This is also only becoming more and more of an issue. Just between 2005 and 2014, teen depression
          rates jumped from 8.7% to 11.3%, the same time social media saw an explosion, and while correlation
          may not be causation, given the previous information on the discrepancy between teenagers who use
          social media and don't, it's hard to argue social media hasn't played a role in this (Stanford Law
          School). The problem is social media leads to constant social comparison, fear of missing out, and
          cyberbullying. It's fueled by constant feedback loops that are intentionally made to maximize
          engagement regardless of the social effects. Even New York City officially classified social media
          platforms as a "public health threat" and filed lawsuits against TikTok, Meta, Snap, and YouTube,
          arguing these companies are "fueling the nationwide youth mental health crisis" (Stanford Law
          School).
        </p>

        <h2>Misinformation at Scale</h2>
        <p>
          Research from MIT shows that false news spreads ten times faster than accurate information on these
          platforms (U.S. PIRG Education Fund). While people may think this is a minor problem or
          unintentional, it's actually baked into the business model of these companies as they profit off
          more engagement with these posts. The 2024 election cycle shows just how big of a problem this is,
          demonstrating how misinformation can shape perception. Fake videos and stories went viral,
          distorting how voters understood both candidates and critical policy issues (Brookings Institution).
          Russian operatives created fake videos about Haitian voter fraud, images showed political figures
          with criminals they'd never met, and there were completely invented stories about immigrants eating
          pets.
        </p>

        <p>
          What's more ridiculous is that just 0.25% of X users generate between 73% and 78% of all
          misinformation on the platform (U.S. PIRG Education Fund). This tiny group exploits the platform's
          algorithms to poison public discourse. Once again, the platforms allow this since outrage drives
          engagement, and engagement generates advertising revenue. Similarly, during the 2024 hurricane
          season, viral misinformation claimed the government only offered $750 in disaster aid, that FEMA
          diverted hurricane relief funds to undocumented immigrants, and that the government actually
          engineered hurricanes to target Republican states (News Literacy Project). This led to outrage from
          Republicans, further dividing the country.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Invasion</h2>
        <p>
          The Federal Trade Commission investigated nine major social media and streaming companies to find a
          stunning amount of what they called "vast surveillance" of users (Federal Trade Commission). These
          platforms didn't just collect data about posts, but they also tracked user behavior across the
          internet, purchased information from data brokers, and retained data even when users requested
          deletion. In some cases, they even collect information about people who don't use their services.
          All of this was just to monetize every aspect of human behavior through targeted advertising.
        </p>

        <p>
          To avoid compliance with child privacy laws, companies claim children don't use their platforms,
          even though everyone knows this is false (Federal Trade Commission). This leaves these
          impressionable younger people with no special protections from these platforms.  A
          comprehensive study about this in the United UAE found that 86.7% of participants had
          privacy concerns related to social media surveillance of their data (Frontiers in Sociology). They
          know they're being watched, tracked, and monetized, but there's nothing they can really do
          about it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Regulation Fails</h2>
        <p>
          Addressing these harms through regulation has proven nearly impossible due to constitutional
          constraints and technical challenges. States including Utah, California, Arkansas, Ohio, and Texas
          have attempted to pass laws protecting children from social media's documented harms, but federal
          judges consistently strike these down via the First Amendment (JURIST). Essentially, the Supreme
          Court says that platforms possess free speech rights to allow whatever they want on their platform.
          This creates a problem since it means these companies can claim editorial protections but are also
          free of the responsibility that comes with it (Congress.gov).
        </p>

        <p>
          Some legal scholars argue the Supreme Court is too old to understand how modern social media
          functions. They don't truly understand the reality that these companies actively pick what billions
          of people see each day (Baker Institute). This misunderstanding has made policy advancement nearly
          impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are also plenty of technical challenges. How do platforms verify age without creating privacy
          violations or building databases of sensitive identity information? How do individual states enforce
          regulations on global platforms? How do you moderate content at the scale of billions of users
          without either allowing widespread harm or engaging in excessive censorship? (Congress.gov). All of
          these are problems we don't yet know the answer to.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Completely getting rid of social media isn't realistic, but we could definitely benefit from
          dramatically decreasing our reliance on it. Something like a digital literacy program
          could help people recognize the effects of social media and train them to evaluate information they see online more
          critically (Stanford Law School). Parents and schools could also establish and enforce stricter limits.
          There are so many other options to try to limit the negatives of social media.
