          <p class="lead">
            Over the past 15–20 years, social media has become one of the main ways people communicate, get
            news, and share their lives online. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, X, and Facebook connect
            billions of users around the world and shape how information spreads every day. In its early
            years, many people saw social media as an exciting, mostly positive innovation that made the
            world feel more connected and gave everyday users a louder voice. Over time though, evidence
            about misinformation, mental health harms, and privacy violations has made public opinion much
            more divided and raised serious ethical and policy questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a social and ethical standpoint, social media has clearly changed how communities form and
            how public conversations happen. It allows people to build relationships across distance, find
            niche communities, and organize around causes that might have been ignored by traditional media,
            which is part of why many users still experience it as empowering and inclusive. At the same
            time, these same features make it easier for harmful content to spread quickly, including
            harassment, hate speech, and targeted abuse, which raises questions about the responsibility
            platforms have to protect their users while still respecting free expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Politics and democracy are some of the most contested areas in this debate. Researchers studying
            recent elections have found that false or misleading political content can travel faster and
            farther than accurate information on major platforms, especially when it provokes strong
            emotions. Reports on more recent election cycles describe a growing mix of disinformation,
            AI-generated content, and conspiracy narratives that can undermine trust in institutions and
            make it harder for citizens to agree on basic facts. This creates a tension between the
            democratic benefits of easier political participation and the risks of manipulation,
            polarization, and declining trust in the electoral process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another major area of concern involves mental health, especially for teens and young adults.
            Studies and public health guidance describe social media as a “double-edged sword”: it can
            provide connection, peer support, and access to helpful information, but it can also contribute
            to anxiety, depression, social comparison, and sleep disruption when use becomes excessive or
            toxic. Recent reports on youth mental health emphasize that algorithmic feeds, endless
            scrolling, and exposure to idealized images or cyberbullying can intensify existing
            vulnerabilities, which is why some cities and health agencies have started classifying social
            media as a potential public health risk that needs closer attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Privacy and data use raise another set of ethical and policy issues. Many large platforms
            collect extensive information about users’ behavior, locations, and interests, building detailed
            profiles that can be used for targeted advertising and recommendation algorithms. Advocacy
            groups and regulators have criticized this “surveillance-style” business model, arguing that
            users often do not fully understand what is being collected or how long it is stored, and that
            children and teens are especially exposed when companies under-enforce age limits or children’s
            privacy protections. These practices force policymakers to consider how to balance innovation
            and free services with stronger privacy rights and data protection rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of all these tensions, governments around the world are debating how or whether social
            media should be more tightly regulated. Some proposals focus on transparency and accountability,
            such as requiring companies to explain how their algorithms work or to report more clearly on
            how they handle harmful content and political advertising. Others push for stricter rules on
            data collection, age verification, or platform responsibility for illegal content, but these
            ideas run into serious First Amendment and free-expression concerns in countries like the United
            States, as well as practical problems in enforcing rules on global platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central question then is whether social media is a net positive for society or whether we
            would be better off with far less of it. Surveys in advanced economies suggest that people are
            split, many say social media helps them stay informed and connected, while many others believe
            it has a negative impact on politics and society overall. In this project, Devin’s section
            focuses on the positive side, how social media can amplify marginalized voices, support civic
            engagement, and enable humanitarian action. While Yoyo’s section examines the harms, including
            mental health issues, misinformation, privacy violations, and the challenges of effective
            regulation. Together, these perspectives show that social media is best understood as a powerful
            but contested technology whose impact depends on how it is designed, governed, and used.
